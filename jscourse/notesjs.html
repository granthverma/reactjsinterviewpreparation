variable is vari + able 

vari - changeable    
able = ho skta ha  

lab ko pyar hua laby se 
phar shadi bhi ho dono ki 
but laby ek ex bf mr xyz
wo aaya zindgi mein aur le kar chal gaya labi ko 

so us variable zindgi main change ho skta ha 

but jo constants hota ha wo forever ho skta ha koi bhi aaya jaya koi farak nahi padta hai
