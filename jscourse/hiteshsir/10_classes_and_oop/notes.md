# javascript and classes

 yes javascript have classes this feature was introduced with the ECmascript 2015  specification (often referred to as ES6 ) However , its important to note that javascript is primarily a prototype based language and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype - based inheritance 
 in other words it provides a more familiar systax for developer coming from class-based languages such as java or c++
 but under hoad it works somewhat differently
